## Quick Reference: The Golden Rules

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 80/20 Headlines | 80% of results come from headlines/hooks |
| Volume First | Do 10x more before optimizing |
| Proof > Promise | Show results, don't just claim them |
| Narrow > Broad | Dominate a niche before expanding |
| Simple Wins | Third-grade reading level converts best |

---

## 1. Headlines & Hooks

### The 80/20 Rule
- Spend 80% of your effort on the first 5 seconds
- Headlines determine if anyone sees the rest
- A good hook can 2x-5x your results

### Hook Formula Templates

```
How to [DESIRED OUTCOME] without [PAIN POINT] even if [BIGGEST FEAR]
```

**Example:** "How to speak confidently in front of strangers without ever practicing even if you're deathly afraid of public speaking"

### Hook Checklist
- [ ] Creates curiosity
- [ ] Is different from competitors
- [ ] Calls out specific audience
- [ ] Can be understood in 3 seconds
- [ ] Third-grade reading level

### Hook Creation Process
1. Write 50 hooks per session
2. 40 hooks (80%) = proven winners from past
3. 10 hooks (20%) = new experimental ideas
4. Test on organic content first
5. Steal from different industries

---

## 2. The Call-Out Framework

### Who to Target
```
"This is for [SPECIFIC PERSON] who [SPECIFIC SITUATION]"
```

### Who to Exclude (More Powerful)
```
"If you're [WRONG FIT], this isn't for you"
```

**Example:** "Only for people trying to lose over 30 lbs" excludes casual dieters and attracts serious buyers.

### Five Levels of Awareness

| Level | Description | How to Hook Them |
|-------|-------------|------------------|
| Unaware | Don't know problem exists | Curiosity-based hooks |
| Problem Aware | Know the problem | "Do you experience [symptom]?" |
| Solution Aware | Know solutions exist | "Have you tried [solution type]?" |
| Product Aware | Know your product category | Compare to alternatives |
| Most Aware | Know you specifically | Make direct offers |

### Specificity Wins
❌ "Are you overweight?"
✅ "Do you have trouble walking upstairs without sweating in places you didn't know you could?"

**Rule:** Describe moments, not vague concepts.

---

## 3. The Damaging Admission Technique

### Structure
```
[ADMIT FLAW] but [BENEFIT YOU WANT THEM TO BELIEVE]
```

### Examples
| Damaging Admission | Benefit |
|-------------------|---------|
| "These markers smell terrible" | "but they write 4x longer" |
| "Our gym has bad parking" | "but our sessions are more fun than anyone else's" |
| "Our websites are ugly" | "but they convert like crazy" |
| "This only works for 4-6 hours" | "but you'll have the time of your life" |

### Why It Works
- Admitting flaws builds trust
- Trust trumps promise
- What comes after "but" is what they believe
- Addresses objections before they think them

### Action Step
List all your flaws/complaints, then pair each with your strongest benefit.

---

## 4. The Value Equation

### Four Variables of Value

```
                Dream Outcome × Perceived Likelihood
VALUE = ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
              Time Delay × Effort Required
```

### Maximize Value By:

| Variable | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Dream Outcome | Promise what they actually want (status, money, health) |
| Likelihood | Add proof, guarantees, testimonials |
| Time | Make it faster ("results in 7 days") |
| Effort | Make it easier ("done-for-you", "just push a button") |

### The Ultimate Offer
- Something they desperately want
- Zero risk (guaranteed)
- Instant results
- No effort required

---

## 5. Proof & Authority

### Types of Proof

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| Results | "Average customer gains $100k/year" |
| Volume | "Helped 5,000+ businesses" |
| Longevity | "In business for 40 years" |
| Credentials | "Only triple black belt in Ohio" |
| Social | "4.6 stars from 4,000 reviews" |
| Media | "As seen on Forbes, Oprah" |

### Proof Presentation Formula
```
[X%] of [WHO] achieve [OUTCOME] in [TIMEFRAME] under [CONDITIONS]
```

**Example:** "The average gym owner makes an extra $100,000 per year in profit after their first 12 months in our program"

### Say What Only You Can Say
- Competitors can copy your offer
- Competitors cannot copy your proof
- Document everything you do
- Track all customer results

---

## 6. Urgency & Scarcity

### Two Types

| Type | Based On | Example |
|------|----------|---------|
| Scarcity | Quantity | "Only 100 spots available" |
| Urgency | Time | "Offer ends at midnight" |

### Making It Work
- **Must be real** - Say no when limits are hit
- **Must be enforced** - Builds reputation for next time
- **Can use any reason** - Birthday, anniversary, dog's birthday

### The Fraternity Party Planner Rule
Any reason is better than no reason:
- "It's my business anniversary"
- "It's my dog's birth month"
- "We just hit a milestone"

---

## 7. Copy Writing Rules

### Third-Grade Reading Level
- Short sentences
- Small words
- Big promises
- Few adverbs, better verbs

❌ "He quickly ran"
✅ "He sprinted"

### Test Your Copy
1. Use a free reading level calculator
2. Edit until it hits third-grade level
3. Delete anything that makes them pause

### The Reader Assumption
Assume they:
- Have no idea who you are
- Are in a rush
- Don't care about your thing
- Have a third-grade reading level
- Are distracted

### Every Line Sells the Next Line
```
Headline → sells reading the first line
First line → sells reading the next line
Body → sells the click
Landing page → sells the opt-in
Opt-in → sells showing up
```

---

## 8. PS Statements

### Two Most-Read Parts
1. Headline
2. PS Statement

### Three PS Strategies

| Strategy | When to Use | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| Exclusion | Filter wrong customers | "PS: If you're under $500k/year, this isn't for you" |
| Recap | Summarize main points | "PS: We've helped 1,000 people become black belts. If you're serious, click here" |
| Reward | Build habit for CTAs | "PS: Here's a joke..." (then occasionally use for CTAs) |

---

## 9. Clear CTAs (Calls to Action)

### Make It Stupid Simple
```
"Click the button below. On the next page, fill in your information.
Then select a convenient time. You'll receive a confirmation email."
```

### The Say-Do Correspondence
1. Tell them what to do
2. Tell them what will happen
3. Deliver exactly that
4. Repeat (builds trust and influence)

**Example:** Martha Stewart gives recipes → people follow → cake turns out → she gains influence for next recipe.

---

## 10. Pricing Strategy

### Start Low, Scale Up
1. Start free or low to get testimonials
2. Every 5 customers, increase by 20%
3. Stop when: conversion rate × price drops
4. You've found your sweet spot

### Free Customer Value
Free customers provide:
- [ ] Become paying customers later
- [ ] Referrals
- [ ] Testimonials/reviews
- [ ] Feedback for improvement

### The Exchange
```
"I'll do this for free in exchange for:
1. Honest feedback
2. A public testimonial (if you're happy)
3. A referral (if I do a good job)"
```

---

## 11. LTV to CAC Ratio

### The Only Metric That Matters
```
LTV (Lifetime Gross Profit) ÷ CAC (Cost to Acquire Customer)
```

### Benchmarks

| Ratio | Status |
|-------|--------|
| 3:1 | Minimum viable |
| 5:1 | Healthy |
| 10:1 | Strong |
| 30:1+ | Scale aggressively |

### Calculation
1. Total gross profit last year ÷ Total customers = LTV
2. Total marketing + sales costs ÷ New customers = CAC
3. LTV ÷ CAC = Your ratio

### Golden Rule
Get your CAC back in the first 30 days, then the rest is profit.

---

## 12. Scaling Framework

### The Progression

| Revenue | Focus |
|---------|-------|
| $0-$100k | 1 product, 1 avatar, 1 channel |
| $100k-$1M | Same, but consistent |
| $1M-$10M | 1 avatar, 1 channel, 2 products (add upsell) |
| $10M+ | 1 avatar, 2 channels, 2 products |

### More → Better → New

```
1. MORE: Increase volume (do 10x more)
   ↓
2. BETTER: Optimize (when ROI of better > ROI of more)
   ↓
3. NEW: Try new channels (only when current maxed)
```

### The 10X Question
"What would break first if we 10x'd tomorrow?"
→ Fix that thing → Then scale → Find next bottleneck → Repeat

---

## 13. Four Ways to Advertise

| Method | Type | Example |
|--------|------|---------|
| Warm Outreach | 1:1, know you | DMs to past customers |
| Cold Outreach | 1:1, strangers | Cold emails, cold calls |
| Content | 1:many, know you | YouTube, podcasts, posts |
| Paid Ads | 1:many, strangers | Facebook ads, Google ads |

### The 4-Hour Rule
First 4 hours of every day should be spent on one of these four activities.

---

## 14. Niche Down Strategy

### Better Creates Bigger
- Don't expand to grow
- Get better at serving current niche
- Growth is an outcome, not a goal

### The Vista PE Method
1. List all customers
2. Identify top 20% by profit
3. Find what they have in common
4. Only sell to those people going forward
5. Phase out bottom 80%

### Five Ways to Expand (When Ready)

| Direction | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Up-market | Higher value, fewer customers |
| Down-market | Lower value, more customers |
| Adjacent | Similar avatar, different business model |
| Narrower | Even more specific niche |
| Broader | Wider category |

---

## 15. Ad Creation Workflow

### Daily Habit
- No premium accounts (watch all ads)
- Screenshot/record interesting hooks
- Save to swipe file folder

### Recording Day Process
1. Morning: Review swipe files
2. Review your historical winners
3. Write 50 hooks (40 proven, 10 new)
4. Write 3-5 meat/body sections
5. Write 1-3 CTAs
6. Record everything

### The Kaleidoscope Process (Squeeze Winners)
When you find a winner, multiply it:
- [ ] Change background colors
- [ ] Add/change props
- [ ] Re-record same script
- [ ] Reorder sections
- [ ] Add visual filters (B&W, sepia)
- [ ] Add visual effects
- [ ] Change fonts/captions
- [ ] Change pacing/speed
- [ ] Add music
- [ ] Keep hook, new body

---

## 16. Show Don't Tell

### Describe Experiences, Not Results

❌ "Get more sales"
✅ "Running out of order forms because customers are reading credit cards over the phone too fast"

❌ "Get more leads"
✅ "Having to reorganize your gym to make room for all the new members"

### Describe Future Problems They'd Prefer
- "The overwhelm of too many phones ringing"
- "Not enough salespeople to handle the volume"
- "Having to turn customers away"

---

## 17. Status-Based Benefits

### Tie Everything to Status
```
"A cookbook so fast and easy that all your friends will wonder
how you found the time to be fit AND cook for your family"
```

### Who Gives Them Status?
- Family
- Friends
- Colleagues
- Rivals/Competitors
- Community

### Time Frames
- Past: "Your old classmates won't recognize you"
- Present: "Your spouse will notice tonight"
- Future: "Your kids will brag about you"

---

## 18. Content Strategy

### We Need to Be Reminded More Than Taught
- Your audience hasn't seen most of your content
- Reruns work (Friends is watched more now than before)
- Same concept, different formats/stories

### Infinite Content Wheel
```
Make content → Get comments/questions → Make content about questions → Repeat
```

### Format Variations
Same concept across:
- Written (blog, book)
- Audio (podcast)
- Video (YouTube, course)
- Visual (whiteboard, infographic)
- Applied to different industries
