## SALES MULTIPLIERS (Before You Even Talk)

| Action | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Sell 7 days/week | +29% revenue (104 extra days/year) |
| Respond in <1 min | +391% close likelihood |
| Respond in <5 min | Avoid 80% drop in close rate |
| Same-day/next-day scheduling | Higher show rates |
| 15-min time slots | More convenient = more bookings |
| Best leads → Best closers | 5x potential revenue increase |

## BEFORE THE CALL

### Prep Checklist (5 min)
- [ ] Research prospect (LinkedIn, website, socials)
- [ ] Read all prior notes from setter/previous calls
- [ ] Identify 2-3 specific things about their situation
- [ ] Know their industry pain points

### Reminder Sequence (Manual)
| When | What |
|------|------|
| 24 hours before | Voice/video: "Did prep for you, excited to share 3 things" |
| Morning of | Text: "Looking forward to our call today" |
| 1 hour before | Text: "See you in 60 min, let me know if any issues" |

### BANT Qualification
- **B**udget - Can they afford it?
- **A**uthority - Can they decide?
- **N**eed - Do they have the problem?
- **T**iming - Do they want to start soon?

---

## THE CLOSER FRAMEWORK

### C - Clarify Why They're Here
> "What made you reach out to us?"
> "What made you take the time to hop on this call today?"

### L - Label the Problem
> "So just to make sure I'm clear - you're at [X], you want to get to [Y], and [Z] has been holding you back. Is that right?"

### O - Overview Past Pain (Pain Cycle)
> "What have you tried so far to solve this?"
> "What did you like about it? What didn't work?"

**Purpose:** Deprivation creates motivation. Expand their awareness of the gap.

**Quantify the pain:**
- How much time lost?
- How much money spent?
- What's the daily cost of not solving this?

### S - Sell the Vacation (3-Pillar Pitch)
Talk about the **destination**, not the plane ride.

**Format:** Statement + Metaphor (2 min max)

Example framework:
> "You need three things: [Pillar 1], [Pillar 2], [Pillar 3]. It's like a stool - remove one leg and it falls over. That's why [past solution] didn't work - it only had two."

### E - Explain Away Concerns
See objection handling section below.

### R - Reinforce the Decision
**When they say YES → SHUT UP and collect payment.**

Do NOT:
- Bring up new features
- Add more details
- Keep selling

---

## OBJECTION HANDLING

### First Response Questions
| Situation | Ask |
|-----------|-----|
| First "no" | "What's your main concern?" |
| Deeper resistance | "What are you afraid of happening?" |
| Vague stalling | "What are the variables you're using to decide?" |
| Still stuck | "What would make this a yes?" |
| Total block | "What would make this a no?" |

### The AAA Framework
1. **Acknowledge** - Repeat back what they said
2. **Associate** - Connect to something positive/someone similar
3. **Ask** - Move forward with next question

> "Totally understand. [Acknowledge] Actually, I just spoke with someone this morning who had the same concern. [Associate] Can I share what helped them? [Ask]"

### All-Purpose Closes
Works for almost any objection:

> "Do you think the reason you're on the phone today is because you've struggled to make this decision in the past?"

> "On a scale of 1-10, where are you? ... What would make it a 10?"

> "Best case: [outcome they want]. Worst case: [you're back where you started, which is where you've been anyway]. Does that feel like a bet worth taking?"

### By Objection Type

#### "I need to think about it"
> "Totally fair. What specifically do you need to think about?"
> "What information would help you make this decision right now?"

#### "I need to talk to my spouse"
> "I get it. Let me ask - if they said no, what would you do?"
> "Are you looking for permission or support? Because those are different things."

Play it out:
> "Let's play this out 5 years. If you keep needing permission for everything... is that the dynamic you want?"

#### "I don't have the money"
> "Is it that you don't have it, or that you're not sure it's worth it?"
> "What have you invested in before that you weren't sure you could afford? How did that work out?"

> "You need resourcefulness, not resources."

#### "I don't have time"
> "Is this a seasonal thing or always?"
> "You're here now - when were you imagining you'd do this?"
> "If it's always busy, shouldn't you start when you have the most support?"

#### "It's too expensive"
> "Compared to what?"
> "What would make the price worth it to you?"
> "What's it costing you NOT to solve this - every day, every month?"

## DETAIL QUESTIONS (Death Traps)

**Never answer blind.** Always ask first:

| They Ask | You Ask |
|----------|---------|
| "What days are you open?" | "What days were you looking for?" |
| "What's included?" | "What were you hoping would be included?" |
| "What certifications do you have?" | "Which certifications are you looking for?" |

**If pressed, use the Mechanic Close:**
> "I can't ethically answer that until we look under the hood. Anyone who gives you an answer without understanding your situation first - run the other way."

**Chunk up to the reason:**
> "It sounds like the reason you're asking is because you want to make sure [X]. Is that fair? Well, let me tell you..."

---

## SCRIPT DELIVERY

### The Formula
**Words + Emphasis + Tone + Pacing**

| Element | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Slow down | Importance, trust, vulnerability |
| Speed up | Excitement, energy transfer |
| Pause | Let it land, create space |
| Tone up ↑ | Implies question, invites response |
| Tone down ↓ | Statement, authority, certainty |

### Same words, different meaning:
- "I didn't say he hit his wife" (someone else said it)
- "I didn't *say* he hit his wife" (I implied it)
- "I didn't say *he* hit his wife" (someone else did)
- "I didn't say he hit *his wife*" (he hit someone else)

---

## KEY LAWS & PRINCIPLES

| Principle | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| Listen 2x more than you talk | They need to say it, not you |
| Be like smoke | Questions can't be disagreed with |
| He who asks most, closes most | Questions = control |
| They believe nothing you say | They believe everything THEY say |
| Pain is the pitch | Deprivation creates motivation |
| Prep = Smooth | 5 min research = genius status |
| Details are death | Chunk up to the reason behind the question |
| BAMFAM | Book A Meeting From A Meeting |
| Kill zombies early | Address objections BEFORE price |
| Rapport = unlimited shots | Curiosity > Combativeness |

## DAILY HABITS

### Off-Call SOP
- [ ] Follow up with yesterday's no-shows
- [ ] Pull up future appointments to today
- [ ] Push unresponsive leads, open slots for hot ones
- [ ] Work the kill list (high-value prospects)
- [ ] Send "where you at" memes to cold pipeline
- [ ] Ask for referrals from recent closes

### On-Call SOP
- [ ] Review notes before each call
- [ ] Set the agenda in first 30 seconds
- [ ] Follow the script exactly
- [ ] Take notes during call
- [ ] BAMFAM before hanging up
- [ ] Update CRM immediately after

### Questions to Ask After Every Call
1. Did I listen more than I talked?
2. Did I kill zombies before mentioning price?
3. Did I ask for the sale? How many times?
4. What would I do differently?

---

## WHEN YOU'RE IN A SLUMP

1. **Record yourself when hot** - Analyze what you do differently
2. **Read testimonials** - Rebuild conviction
3. **Drill one thing** - Don't try to fix everything at once
4. **Jump on a mini trampoline** - Can't frown while jumping (seriously)
5. **Take the "bad" leads** - Free practice with stakes

---

## REFERRAL SCRIPT

> "Who do you know who's as awesome as you, who would also benefit from this?"

If they say "no one":
> "Why do you hate me so much? [laugh] I can only assume you either hate us or you hate your friends because you don't want them to have this."

---

## OUTBOUND COLD SCRIPT

**Voicemail/Email:**
> "Hey [Business], calling about [Competitor]. Give me a call back."

**When they call back:**
> "Yeah, looks like they're kicking your ass. We've reached out to them too and..."

---

## LOCAL LEAD CALL SCRIPT

> "[Name]? ... This is [Your Name]. ... I'm calling because you opted in on Facebook for our [specific promotion]. I wanted to make sure you weren't a crazy person on the internet, and that you knew we weren't crazy people either. What time works for you to come in - I've got 2:00 and 4:00 today, which works better?"

---

## THE CORE PHILOSOPHY

> "Sales is an education process over a bridge of trust. If the prospect knew everything you knew, they would buy."

> "Your job is to fill in the fewest gaps needed for them to make the decision."

> "Whoever cares most about the prospect wins the sale."

> "You want to be right, or you want to be rich? You become rich by making THEM right."

*"Good closers try to get hot. Great closers never get cold."*
