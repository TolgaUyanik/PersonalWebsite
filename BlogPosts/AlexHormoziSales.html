                    — Alex Hormozi
                </div>

                <p>Alex Hormozi has personally closed over <span class="stat-highlight">4,000 sales</span>, built multiple nine-figure sales teams, and scaled teams from zero to 40-60 reps. His software company, Allen, schedules <span class="stat-highlight">4,000+ appointments per day</span> across industries—giving him unprecedented data on what actually works from click to close.</p>

                <p>I've analyzed two of his most comprehensive sales trainings—totaling over 3 hours of content—and distilled everything into actionable frameworks, scripts, and tactics. This isn't theory. This is battle-tested wisdom from someone who has closed deals in the trenches.</p>

                </div>

                <p>These are the things that happen <em>outside</em> the sale that affect your numbers more than anything you say on the call. Master these first.</p>

                        <h4>Sell 7 Days Per Week</h4>
                        <p>52 weeks × 2 days = 104 extra sales days per year. Weekend prospects are often more available and less stressed than weekday callers.</p>

                    <h4>The Nail Salon Lesson</h4>
                    <p>When Leila needed her nails done in a new city, she called the top-rated salon. "We're appointment only—can book you in two days." She hung up. Called the next one. Same thing. Third one said "We can take you right now." They got the business—and probably her repeat business forever. <strong>The first two lost money by not being available.</strong></p>
                </div>

                <h3>Feed the Killers</h3>
                <p>One of Alex's most counterintuitive strategies: <strong>Best leads go to best closers. Worst leads go to worst closers.</strong></p>

                <div class="key-concept">
                    <h4>The Time Share Story</h4>
                    <p>The #1 sales rep at a multi-billion dollar timeshare company (out of 3,000 reps) won the sales competition and got one hour with the CEO. His pitch: "Stop giving me garbage leads and giving qualified prospects to new reps. Give me the best leads—I'll close them. Give new reps the hard ones to learn on."</p>
                    <p>Result: His income went from <strong>$250,000/year to $3 million/year</strong>. When rolled out company-wide, it <strong>5x'd the entire business</strong>.</p>

His response: "But you're trying to lose weight. Worst case you can't afford food and lose some weight. Win-win." She laughed—and he closed her.</p>

                    <h2>7. The Art of Asking</h2>
                </div>

                <div class="law-box">
                    <h4>The Law of Closing</h4>
                    <p><strong>He who asks the most times gets the most sales.</strong></p>
                </div>

                <p>But here's the catch: if you ask wrong, you lose rapport and can't ask again. The key is maintaining rapport so you get unlimited shots on goal.</p>

                <h3>Details Are Death Traps</h3>
                <p>When prospects ask detail questions, they're trying to find something to nitpick. Never answer blind.</p>

                <table class="comparison-table">
                    <tr>
                        <th>They Ask</th>
                        <th>You Ask Back</th>

                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>"What's included?"</td>
                        <td>"What were you hoping would be included?"</td>
                    </tr>

                        <td>"What certifications do you have?"</td>

                    </tr>
                </table>

                <h3>The Mechanic Close</h3>
                <p>If they press hard on details you can't answer:</p>
                <div class="script-box">
                    <p><span class="speaker">You:</span> "I can't ethically answer that until we look under the hood. It's like asking a mechanic what's wrong with your car before you bring it in. Anyone who gives you an answer without understanding your situation first—run the other way."</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Be Like Smoke</h3>
                <p>Questions can't be disagreed with. Statements can. When you answer with a question, they can't attack you.</p>

                <div class="script-box">
                    <p><span class="speaker">Prospect:</span> "What makes you better than your competition?"</p>
                    <p><span class="speaker">You:</span> "What things are you looking for?"</p>
                    <p><span class="speaker">Prospect:</span> "I want X, Y, and Z."</p>
                    <p><span class="speaker">You:</span> "Why are those important to you?"</p>
                    <p><em>Hot potato—right back to them. You're like smoke. They can't catch you.</em></p>
                </div>

                <div class="key-concept">
                    <h4>They Believe Nothing You Say</h4>
                    <p>They believe everything THEY say. That's why you ask questions—you need them to say it's a good idea, not you.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Childlike Curiosity</h3>
                <p>When they say no, your instinct shouldn't be to hard-close. It should be genuine curiosity:</p>
                <div class="script-box">
                    <p><span class="speaker">You:</span> "Huh. That's interesting. I wouldn't have expected that. Can you tell me more about that?"</p>
                </div>
                <p>Head tilted up. Genuinely curious. Not competitive. This keeps rapport intact.</p>
            </section>

            <!-- SECTION 8: CONSISTENCY -->
            <section id="consistency">
                <div class="lesson-header">
                    <h2>8. Consistency & Meta-Skills</h2>
                </div>

                <p>Maximum opportunities + maximum conversion rate = nothing if you can only do it for a day. The difference between champions and everyone else: <strong>sustained performance</strong>.</p>

                <h3>Dogs, Horses, and Tigers</h3>
                <div class="example-box">
                    <p><strong>Dogs:</strong> Need to be fed, need belly rubs, die without constant attention</p>
                    <p><strong>Horses:</strong> Gallop when you whip, trot when you stop</p>
                    <p><strong>Tigers:</strong> Can eat a full meal, but if a bunny walks by, they'll kill it for sport</p>
                </div>
                <p><strong>You want tigers.</strong> They love the thrill of the hunt. They'd do this for free.</p>

                <h3>Kill for Sport</h3>
                <p>Every "bad" lead is free practice with stakes. When Alex sold weight loss, homeless people would sometimes respond to his ads. Two options:</p>
                <ul class="action-list">
                    <li>Just get through it and move on</li>
                    <li>See it as free practice and close them anyway</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The number of times "poor-looking" prospects turned out to have money was more than he could count. And even if they don't buy, you just sharpened your sword.</p>

                <h3>Track Data Religiously</h3>
                <p>The skill of any person in any endeavor is judged by the quantity and quality of metrics they track.</p>

                <table class="comparison-table">
                    <tr>
                        <th>Metric</th>
                        <th>Why It Matters</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Schedule Rate</td>
                        <td>Are you booking appointments?</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Show Rate</td>
                        <td>Are they actually showing up?</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Offer Rate</td>
                        <td>Are you getting to the pitch?</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Close Rate</td>
                        <td>Are you closing?</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Cash Collected</td>
                        <td>Are you getting paid?</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Calls to Close</td>
                        <td>One-call? Two-call? Average?</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>

                <p><strong>Key insight:</strong> Increasing show rate by 20% is just as valuable as increasing close rate by 20%—and usually way easier.</p>

                <h3>Never Blame Circumstances</h3>
                <div class="mantra-list">
                    <div class="mantra-item">"The leads are fine. I need to get better."</div>

                    <div class="mantra-item">"The worse the lead, the more I flex my skill."</div>
                </div>

                <h3>When You're in a Slump</h3>
                <ol class="action-list">
                    <li><strong>Record yourself when hot</strong> — Analyze what you do differently when you're closing everything</li>

                    <li><strong>Drill one thing</strong> — Don't try to fix everything at once</li>
                    <li><strong>Jump on a mini trampoline</strong> — You literally cannot frown while jumping (Alex used this between sessions when doing 25+ sales per day)</li>

                <h3>Follow the Script</h3>
                <p>If your team doesn't follow the script, there's no point in having one. Script adherence comes first. The script should include:</p>
                <ul class="action-list">
                    <li><strong>Words</strong> — What to say</li>
                    <li><strong>Emphasis</strong> — Which words to stress</li>
                    <li><strong>Tone</strong> — When to go up/down</li>
                    <li><strong>Pacing</strong> — When to slow down for importance</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="key-concept">
                    <h4>Same Words, Different Meaning</h4>
                    <p>"I didn't say he hit his wife" has 7 different meanings depending on which word you emphasize. The script isn't just words—it's how you deliver them.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>When They Say Yes</h3>
                <div class="golden-rule">
                    <h4>SHUT UP</h4>
                    <p>The moment you have agreement, stop talking. Ask for payment info. Close. Do not bring up new features. Do not add details. Do not sell yourself out of a sale.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>The Core Philosophy</h3>
                <div class="quote-highlight">
                    "Sales is an education process over a bridge of trust. If the prospect knew everything you knew, they would buy. Your job is to fill in the fewest gaps needed for them to make the decision."
                </div>

                <div class="quote-highlight">
                    "You want to be right, or you want to be rich? You become rich by making THEM right."
                </div>

                <div class="quote-highlight">
                    "Whoever cares most about the prospect wins the sale."

                <h3>Final Thought</h3>
                <p>Good closers try to get hot. <strong>Great closers never get cold.</strong></p>
                <p>They've systematized every single thing that creates the "hot streak." They breathe the script. They know every objection handle by heart. They prep for every call. They track every metric. And they care more about the prospect than the prospect cares about themselves.</p>
                <p>That's the game. Now go play it.</p>
