      <h1>🧠 How I’m Using Neuroscience to Upgrade My Focus, Energy, and Stress Recovery</h1>
      <p>Recently, I took a deep dive into one of the most insightful neuroscience breakdowns I've come across — a talk by Dr. Andrew Huberman. With a little help from ChatGPT, I summarized and structured the main takeaways into an actionable plan that’s already changing how I work, move, and recover.</p>

      <h2><span class="emoji">🔥</span>1. Stress is Not the Enemy — Chronic Stress Is</h2>
      <p>Huberman explains that stress is useful — it sharpens focus and helps us learn. But when it becomes prolonged, it depletes dopamine and harms mental health.</p>
      <div class="takeaway">
        ✅ <strong>Takeaway:</strong> I’m embracing short-term stress (like tough work sessions), but balancing it with deep rest practices to prevent burnout.

      <h2><span class="emoji">🧘‍♂️</span>2. NSDR (Non-Sleep Deep Rest): Brain Recovery Without Sleeping</h2>
      <p>One of the most powerful tools I’ve adopted is NSDR — a simple practice that resets the nervous system, boosts learning, and recharges motivation. Think of it like a neural “power nap” without actually sleeping.</p>
      <div class="takeaway">
        ✅ <strong>What I’m doing:</strong> 10–20 min daily of Yoga Nidra or guided body scans — especially after high-focus work blocks.
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2><span class="emoji">🏃</span>3. Movement Is Mental Medicine</h2>
      <p>This was a game-changer: exercise doesn’t just improve the body — it directly rewires your brain. Huberman links movement to elevated dopamine, improved mood, focus, and neuroplasticity.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2><span class="emoji">👣</span>Final Thought</h2>
      <p>We often overcomplicate health and focus. What I’ve learned from Huberman is that the right kind of movement, paired with strategic rest, can completely reset how your brain works — and feels.</p>
      <p>If you're interested in neuroscience-backed routines that actually fit real life, I highly recommend exploring NSDR and Huberman's protocols. And feel free to message me if you want the PDF guide I built from this research.</p>
