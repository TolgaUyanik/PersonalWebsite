                    — Alex Hormozi
                </div>

                <p>Alex Hormozi made his first million at 26 and crossed $100 million in net worth at 31. But before that, he lost everything twice. He missed his entire 20s grinding. He slept on gym floors. He let a customer's kid draw on his walls with permanent marker because he needed the sale to pay for the paint.</p>

                <p>This is not motivational fluff. This is a 7-hour compilation of the most valuable lessons from someone who has lived every word he preaches. I've distilled it into 9 comprehensive lessons covering wealth building, mindset, work ethic, and the brutal truths that separate winners from everyone else.</p>

            <!-- LESSON 1 -->
            <section id="lesson1">
                <div class="lesson-header">
                    <h2>Lesson 1: What I Wish Someone Told Me When I Was Broke</h2>
                </div>

                <p>When Alex started his first brick-and-mortar gym at 23, he didn't know you could hire employees. He cleaned, did billing, sales, taught sessions, and fixed equipment himself. Every night, he would think: "If I didn't wake up tomorrow, I would be okay with it."</p>

                <div class="key-concept">
                    <h4>The Foundation: Two Words</h4>
                    <p><strong>"My fault."</strong> The first lesson of getting out of poverty. Until you own everything that led to this moment, you cannot change it. Whatever you cast blame to is where you cast power to.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>The Glass Metaphor</h3>
                <div class="metaphor-box">
                    <h4>Pulling the Rope of Life</h4>
                    <p>Imagine your life's timeline as a rope you're pulling toward yourself. But the rope has different textures:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Glass</strong> (beginning) — Cuts your hands, extremely painful</li>
                        <li><strong>Coarse/Rough</strong> — Still hurts, but less bloody</li>
                        <li><strong>Neutral</strong> — Tolerable</li>
                        <li><strong>Sweet</strong> — Life starts rewarding you</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>When you work harder than normal (doing your job PLUS building something on the side), you're pulling more rope per day. You're living "three days at a time" — getting through the glass section faster.</p>
                    <p><em>"On a long enough time horizon, everyone would eventually be successful, but people wait too long and they die too early."</em></p>
                </div>

                <h3>The Trap of Delayed Pain</h3>
                <table class="comparison-table">
                    <tr>
                        <th>Poor People</th>
                        <th>Successful People</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Delay pain ("I'll start Monday")</td>
                        <td>Take pain now for pleasure later</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Take pleasure now, pain later</td>
                        <td>Delay gratification</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Surprised when the bill comes due</td>
                        <td>Front-load the cost</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>

                <h3>Showing Up On Time</h3>
                <p>People watch YouTube for complex money-making skills but haven't mastered showing up on time. They want calculus when they can't do addition.</p>

                <div class="quote">
                    "The basics don't make them less important. They're the foundation of a building — arguably more important. They're just simpler to understand but not simpler to do."
                </div>

                <p>The disconnect: people think that because they <em>understand</em> something conceptually, they've <em>mastered</em> the skill. Understanding discipline ≠ being disciplined.</p>
            </section>

            <!-- LESSON 2 -->
            <section id="lesson2">
                <div class="lesson-header">
                    <h2>Lesson 2: How To Win In Your 20s</h2>
                </div>

                <p>Alex advocates for a <span class="stat-highlight">6-day, 12-hour work week</span> for men aged 16-28. "You are valued based on your utility. When you're young, you have none. But you have energy. Trade that energy for experience points."</p>

                <h3>The "Very Broke" Five-Point Plan</h3>
                <p>If you have less than $100,000 in savings:</p>
                <ol class="action-list">
                    <li><strong>Stop eating out.</strong> Discount groceries only.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stop buying new clothes.</strong> Goodwill only.</li>
                    <li><strong>Only attend FREE friend events.</strong> If they don't support your goals, they're not your friends — they're your enemies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Use spare time to:</strong> Apply to better-paying jobs, pick up side hustles, learn higher-paying skills.</li>
                    <li><strong>Find the hardest worker and DOUBLE their output.</strong> If they knock 100 doors, you knock 200.</li>
                    <li><strong>Wait 36 months.</strong></li>
                </ol>

                <div class="key-concept">
                    <h4>Patient with Outputs, Impatient with Inputs</h4>
                    <p>You can't control when money comes (output). You CAN control what you do (input). When feeling impatient about results, use action as your coping mechanism.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>The Tree Metaphor</h3>
                <div class="quote">
                    "You can poison a tree in a second. You just can't grow one real fast. But it doesn't mean that if a seed's planted and you're watering it, it's not growing."
                </div>

                <h3>High-Volume Sales: The Common Thread</h3>
                <p>Every successful friend Alex knows started in high-volume sales environments: door-knocking, cold calling, or in-person businesses with many daily conversations with strangers. Not for a month or six months — for <strong>3-5 years</strong>.</p>

                <p>Skill development = <strong>Volume × Feedback Loops</strong></p>

                <h3>The Banana Story</h3>
                <p>A foreign kid who had never seen a banana bit right into it with the skin. Another child called him an idiot. The adult said: "No, he just doesn't know any better."</p>
                <p><strong>There's a big difference between being dumb and being inexperienced.</strong> You're not stupid — you just don't have reps yet.</p>
            </section>

            <!-- LESSON 3 -->
            <section id="lesson3">
                <div class="lesson-header">
                    <h2>Lesson 3: Building Your Confidence</h2>
                </div>

                <div class="key-concept">
                    <h4>The Core Truth</h4>
                    <p><strong>"Don't build confidence. Build evidence."</strong></p>
                    <p>Confidence is simply a prediction — the likelihood that what you think will happen, will happen. How do you increase that? Have it have happened already.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Confidence Without Evidence = Delusion</h3>

                <p>Alex spent 4.5 years making two podcasts a week — only getting 2-3K downloads/month. It took off at year 5 after he sold a company for $46M.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Finite:</strong> Known players, rules, clear winner → game ends</li>
                    <li><strong>Infinite:</strong> Unknown players, no fixed rules → point is to keep playing</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Marriage, health, business = infinite games. You don't "win" marriage. The point is to stay married.</p>

                <p>A kid spent 3 hours daily on grounded walking, gratitude journal, ice plunge — barely had energy to work. Alex's advice: <strong>Replace 3 hours of routine with 3 hours of work.</strong></p>

                <p>Rich people did "whatever it took" → got rich → filled time with weird routines → told others the routines made them rich.</p>

                <h3>"30 is the New 20" is a Lie</h3>
                <div class="quote">
                    "It's an excuse to take 10 years longer to accomplish the same thing."

                <h3>Seasons of Learning vs. Earning</h3>
                <p>An 18-year-old editor wanted $100K/year starting salary. Alternative: only editor at a no-name company (no growth). Alex's offer: learn from a world-class media team → become creative director later.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Old way:</strong> 2 months building product, 2 years marketing it</li>
                    <li><strong>New way:</strong> 2 years building product, lifetime of zero marketing spend</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>2. Brand</h4>
                <p>Brand = what people learn to associate with you. Who you associate with becomes part of your brand.</p>

                    <h2>Lesson 6: Brutal Truths That Give You an Unfair Advantage</h2>
                </div>

                <h3>1. Pain is the Price of Progress</h3>
                <div class="quote">
                    "You cannot both want progress and live an easy life. These two things conflict."
                </div>

                <h3>2. Happy But Not Satisfied</h3>
                <p>Happy = content with your life (allowed). Satisfied = complacent, no more action (not allowed).</p>
                <p>After a year of "retirement," Alex concluded: <strong>Hard work IS the goal.</strong> Results are just a secondary effect.</p>

                <h3>3. Ignore Critics</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Average people want to keep you average</li>
                    <li>Some want you to fail to justify the risk THEY didn't take</li>
                    <li>Your critics will die → their opinion won't matter then → doesn't matter now</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>4. Selective Productivity (The Ladder Analogy)</h3>
                <div class="metaphor-box">
                    <h4>The Wall</h4>
                    <p>Wall = success threshold requiring critical mass. 4 short ladders (multiple projects) = none reach the top. Take all rungs → put on ONE ladder → get over the wall.</p>
                    <p><strong>"Your plans aren't working because you're not working on the plan. The hard part isn't creating or following the plan — it's sticking with it."</strong></p>
                </div>

                <h3>5. Fear vs. Regret</h3>
                <div class="quote">
                    "Your fear of regret must be greater than your fear of rejection."
                </div>
                <p><strong>Fear only exists in the vague.</strong> Break it into specifics. Actual downside = opinions of people you don't care about.</p>

                <h3>6. Persistence Creates Timing</h3>
                <div class="quote">
                    "You can time everything perfectly if your intention is to never stop."
                </div>
                <p>Don't try to hit 3 specific opportunity windows. Work the whole time → you'll always be ready.</p>

                <h3>7. Envy vs. Effort</h3>
                <p>Three hard truths:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>No one is doing as well as you think</li>
                    <li>You win by growing, not beating people</li>
                    <li>Your biggest threat = a mediocre version of YOU</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>8. Hard Conversations Create Opportunities</h3>
                <div class="quote">
                    "Everything you want is on the other side of a few hard conversations you've been putting off."
                </div>
                <p><strong>Best trade:</strong> Short pain → Long gain. <strong>Worst trade:</strong> Short gain → Long pain (guaranteed loss, just delayed).</p>

                <h3>9. Endure</h3>
                <p>Signed gym lease with $5,000 in bank. Rent was $5,000. Had never made real money. <strong>Necessity is the mother of invention.</strong></p>

                <h3>10. Results > Excuses</h3>
                <div class="key-concept">
                    <p><strong>Leila's quote:</strong> "It's not your fault, but it is still your problem."</p>
                    <p>Excuses = permission slip for mediocrity.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>11. The Hard Way IS the Easy Way</h3>
                <p>The easy way never gets you there. When a shortcut is found → everyone uses it → no longer a shortcut.</p>

                <h3>12. Don't Give Away Your Power</h3>
                <div class="quote">
                    "What offends you controls you. Where you point blame, you point power."
                </div>

                <h3>13. Rejection vs. Regret</h3>
                <p><strong>Losers fear rejection. Winners fear regret.</strong></p>
                <p>Champions are <em>relieved</em> when they win, not excited. They hate losing more than they love winning.</p>

                <h3>14. Consistency Beats Talent</h3>
                <div class="quote">
                    "You can beat most people at anything if you stick with it for a year."
                </div>
                <p>20 hours = basic competency at any skill. People wait 10 years to log the first 20 hours.</p>

                <p>Alex hit $100M net worth at 31, but lost all his money <strong>twice</strong> before that. These rules are the difference.</p>

                <h3>1. Passive Income is a Lie</h3>
                <p>Everyone trades time for money. It's a spectrum of "how active."</p>
                <p><strong>Calculate your hourly rate:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Last year's income ÷ 2,000 = hourly rate (40hr week)</li>
                    <li>Last year's income ÷ 8,000 = actual hourly rate (all waking hours)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If an activity pays more than that number, DO MORE OF IT.</p>

                <h3>2. If You Can't Buy It Twice, Don't Buy It Once</h3>
                <div class="metaphor-box">
                    <h4>The Smoothie King Lesson</h4>
                    <p>Making $6.75/hr after taxes. $13 lunch = 2 hours of work. A third of every shift just to eat.</p>
                    <p><strong>"Would I work a whole shift if someone held up a shirt I didn't need?"</strong></p>
                </div>

                <h3>3. Overestimate a Year, Underestimate a Decade</h3>
                <div class="quote">
                    "Would you sign a contract: make no money for 10 years, but add 1-2 zeros to your net worth at year 10?"

                <p>If yes → <strong>act like it.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Invest in S-M-E 500 (yourself), not S&P 500.</strong> You will always beat the market.</p>

                <h3>4. Only Get Rich Once</h3>
                <p>"Don't bet what you have and need for something you don't have and don't need."</p>
                <p><strong>Partnership rules</strong> (9 failed partnerships before Leila): A partner must have ONE thing you don't — Money, Experience, or Time/Energy — with clear contribution defined.</p>

                <h3>5. Manage Time Before Money</h3>
                <p>Money = encapsulated time. For some, $100 = 4 hours. For others, $100 = 4 minutes.</p>

                <h3>6. Check Bank Account Before Social Media</h3>
                <div class="quote">
                    "As I started paying attention to my money, my money started paying attention to me."
                </div>
                <p>Peter Drucker: "What gets measured gets managed."</p>

                <h3>7. Learn to Make Money Before Making Money Make Money</h3>
                <p>Don't put $1,000 into Dogecoin. Put it into skills.</p>
                <div class="quote">
                    "50% improvement in your skill set → 50% increase in annual income. That beats any stock return."
                </div>

                <h3>8. The 5-9 Rule</h3>
                <p>Everyone has 5am-9am and 5pm-9pm. That's 8 hours/day even with a full-time job.</p>
                <p><strong>Work makes money two ways:</strong> you earn it, and you're not spending it.</p>

                <h3>9. If You Don't Know How You Can Lose, You Will Lose</h3>
                <p>"If something looks amazing and you think 'there's no way I can lose,' you're absolutely going to lose your ass."</p>
                <p>Multiply your estimated risk by 3.</p>

                <h3>1. Take Asymmetric Bets</h3>
                <p>Under 30 with nothing? <strong>Your downside is zero. Your upside is everything.</strong></p>
                <div class="quote">
                    "You never actually start from scratch ever again. After the first time, you start with experience."
                </div>
                <p>Alex had <strong>9 failed businesses</strong> before one worked. 6 of those were at the same time.</p>

                <h3>2. Don't Follow Your Passion</h3>
                <div class="quote">
                    "Passion comes from competence, not creates competence."
                </div>
                <p>Your passions WILL change as you age. Getting good at anything requires boring, monotonous repetition.</p>
                <p><strong>Better approach:</strong> Find things you're good at that people already spend money on.</p>

                    "Do you remember that guy who got rich dropshipping, day trading, buying crypto, and wholesaling all at the same time? Me neither."

                <h3>4. Stop Networking (For Now)</h3>
                <p>Two seasons: <strong>Exploration</strong> (broad, tasting) and <strong>Exploitation</strong> (deep, focused).</p>

                    "An expert is just somebody who's made all the mistakes you can make in a very narrow field."

                <h3>7. Name the Voice</h3>
                <p>Alex almost didn't sell Gym Launch for $46M because he thought a colleague wouldn't be impressed.</p>
                <p><strong>"Whose voice is in your head? Is that the person you want to give control over your entire life?"</strong></p>

                <p>If everything was deleted and Alex had 60 seconds, this is what he'd say:</p>

                <div class="summary-box">
                    <p>"Figure out what you want.<br>
                    Ignore the opinions of others.<br>

                    <strong>unreasonable to not be successful.</strong>"</p>
                </div>

                <p>This isn't motivation. This is math. The person who does 10x the volume, gets 10x the reps, learns 10x the lessons, and compounds 10x the experience will — by sheer mathematics — end up further than everyone who didn't.</p>

                <p>The glass at the beginning of the rope will cut you. The loneliness of outworking your friend group will hurt. The boredom of doing the same thing for years without visible results will test you.</p>
