                    MJ DeMarco’s <em>The Millionaire Fastlane</em> is a manifesto against traditional financial advice. Instead of waiting decades to retire rich, DeMarco teaches how to build wealth while young by creating scalable, controllable systems that separate your income from your time.
                </div>
                <p>This isn’t about reckless shortcuts. The Fastlane is about speed through control, scale, and value creation — turning time into freedom instead of trading it away.</p>

                <h2>2. The Fastlane Formula</h2>
                <p>DeMarco defines wealth as a function of both profit and asset value. Fastlaners focus on <strong>building systems</strong> that generate both cash flow and equity — not hourly wages.</p>

                <p><strong>Wealth = Net Profit + Asset Value</strong></p>

                    <p><strong>The Millionaire Fastlane</strong> redefines wealth creation as a process of value, speed, and ownership. It rejects the “get rich slow” narrative and replaces it with one built on scale, control, and execution.</p>
                    <p>The Fastlane mindset is simple: stop trading your life for money. Build systems that trade value for freedom — and create wealth while you still have the energy to enjoy it.</p>
