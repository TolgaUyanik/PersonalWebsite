                    Tim Ferriss’s <em>The 4-Hour Workweek</em> is not about quitting your job overnight or literally working only four hours a week. It’s a blueprint for creating freedom — time, mobility, and control — through smarter systems, automation, and a new definition of success.
                </div>
                <p>Instead of deferring happiness to “retirement,” Ferriss teaches readers to redesign their lifestyle today. The core method follows the D.E.A.L. framework: <strong>Definition, Elimination, Automation, and Liberation.</strong></p>

                <h2>2. Definition — Redefine Success</h2>
                <p>Ferriss begins by challenging traditional assumptions about work, money, and purpose. True wealth is measured in time and mobility, not cash alone.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Replace the goal of “being rich” with “living richly.”</li>
                    <li>Take <strong>mini-retirements</strong> throughout life instead of one long retirement at the end.</li>
                    <li>Perform the <strong>Fear-Setting Exercise</strong>: define the worst-case scenario and plan how to recover from it.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>3. Elimination — Do Less, Better</h2>
                <p>Ferriss shows how to focus on leverage, not labor. Most people mistake activity for productivity. The goal is to create output with the least necessary input.</p>

                <h2>4. Automation — Income That Runs Itself</h2>
                <p>Ferriss originally framed automation around outsourcing and small online businesses. The principle remains timeless: remove yourself from routine decisions and build systems that operate independently. In today’s context, automation increasingly means <strong>AI leverage</strong> rather than human delegation.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Design one or more <strong>self-running systems</strong> that produce recurring value — not necessarily a business, but a process that compounds over time.</li>
                    <li>Use <strong>AI copilots</strong> to handle repetitive cognitive work and data tasks.</li>
                    <li>Invest in scalable mechanisms like <strong>the stock market</strong> or digital assets that grow without additional hours.</li>
